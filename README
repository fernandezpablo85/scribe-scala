This is **NOT** the production-ready version of scribe. For that go to https://github.com/fernandezpablo85/scribe-scala.

Do **NOT** use this in your production code unless you know exactly what you're doing.

This is going to be Scribe on functional-steroids.

I won't take this too seriously (hint: I didn't with scribe-java at first, and I'm not sure wether I do right now :P) but it will be a good way to actually see what *real* benefits does scala bring to the JVM table.

Hopefully I'll learn something in the meantime :)
